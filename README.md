## Development

Here we have another beautifully designed landing page from Frontend Mentor for this Newbie level challenge. Albeit it says it's a "Newbie" level challenge, you shouldn't underestimate it.

The layout can be a bit tricky becaue of how the CTA section has its components organized. You can find multiple ways to go about it in terms of HTML and CSS, but the main requirement is media queries. Without them, you won't be able to change the layout depending on the screen size. 

Once again, I had the chance to keep practicing with some SCSS best practices, which truly makes the development experience so much better and in the end, it leads to a more productive and fun experience.

There's nothing particularly extraordinary in terms of features, so I don't have much to present for this project.

One aspect I'd like to point out is the background animation I added after I finished the project's development. It's not a mind-blowing animation, but I wanted to add a subtle animation that'd contribute more to the subtle aesthetic of the project.

I always recommend you trying adding your own twist to these designs or / and implement other features besides those listed in the project's requirements. It'll help you develop your creative thinking skills and contribute to your development as a valuable frontend developer.

Let me know what you thought about the projects.
What would've you done differently here?
